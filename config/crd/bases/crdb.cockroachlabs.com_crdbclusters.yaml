                              when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both
                              fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to
                              the same value automatically if one of them is empty
                              and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                              in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the same
                              value and must be empty. There are three important differences
                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                              field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                      description: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that
                        have a label with this key and identical values are considered
                        to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value>
                        as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into
                        each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of
                        a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain
                        whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and
                        nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                        each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                        is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of
                        that topology. It's a required field.

                      description: 'WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a
                        pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule
                        (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                        tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but
                        giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an
                        incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment
                        for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                        with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                        | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is
                        set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                        can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make it *more*
                        imbalanced. It''s a required field.'
