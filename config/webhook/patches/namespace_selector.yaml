# This file is here to ensure that we create a namespaceSelector for the webhooks. This is necessary since, at least at
# the moment, the operator only operates in it's own namespace. This means we could have 2 different versions of the
# operator running on a cluster and we need to be sure the hooks only work with CRs in their own namespace.
