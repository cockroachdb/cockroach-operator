                .CrdbVersions: a slice of CockroachDB versions. Every item uses
                semver.Version as its type. See https://github.com/Masterminds/semver for
                available methods. We use the `Original()` method, which preserves the
                leading "v" in the output.
                The `stable` template function is used to determine if the
                version is stable or alpha/beta/rc. We publish only stable
                versions to RedHat Connect.
                The `underscore` template function replaces all dots with underscores.
